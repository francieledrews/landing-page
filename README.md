# Landing Page Project - DEMO

## Learn learn learn
The starter project has some HTML and CSS styling to display a static version of the Landing Page project. I had to convert this project from a static project to an interactive one. This required modifying the HTML and CSS files, but primarily the JavaScript file.

## The technologies used:
- HTML
- CSS
- JS

## The functionalities:
- the navigation
- the dynamic active class
- the scrolling effect

## How to use the project:
Just open the index.html in any browser. How? 
- first - by clicking with the right mouse button on the file;
- second - selecting the option ```open with```; and then
- third - by clicking on the browser of your choice or available.

Then ta-dah!!
